# GLAF 
### (Grid-based Language and Auto-parallelization Framework) is a visual programming environment mainly targeted to domain scientists with minimal or no prior knowledge of (parallel) programming.

The features of GLAF enable it to provide a balance between performance, programmability, as well as portability, across parallel platforms.
These are:
- Graphical, click-based user interface
- Automatic code generation (C, Fortran, OpenCL)
- Auto-parallelization (OpenMP for C/Fortran, inherently in OpenCL)
- Auto-tuning (data layout - SoA/AoS)
- Visualization

Additional information, including publications, presentations, example programs, and an online demo service are available at http://glaf.cs.vt.edu/
